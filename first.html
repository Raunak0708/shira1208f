	<h1><br>Happy Birthday to the most incredible man in my life! 🥳💖 </br> 
	
You are not just my boyfriend;you are a blessing in every sense of the word. 
 Your sweetness, strength, and ability to handle everything with such grace 
 make you truly one of a kind. Even when you're upset, your care and love 
 never waver—whether  its about ur kaleshi aurat.<br></br>

You have a heart so big and generous, not just for me but for everyone around you.
The way you care for my family, as if they were your own, speaks volumes about 
the incredible person you are.
Your unconditional love and commitment to your parents inspire me every day but i'm lazy as hell so forget about me. 
Starting house hunting for them at just 19(idk precisely ) and standing by them through 
everything—your dedication is truly admirable. You’re working so hard to make 
them proud, and I know they already are because you are everything they could ever
 wish for in a son.
 <br></br>
 I want to celebrate you—the amazing boyfriend, the caring brother, the devoted son,
  and the incredible person you are. You deserve all the happiness in the world because you bring so much joy to everyone around you
